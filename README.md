# ReadMe Generator

# Introduction:

A ReadMe file is important because it is the first file that a person sees when they visit a repository on GitHub. README files contain essential information about the project’s repository. Therefore, the quality of a README file can differentiate a high-quality repo from a low-quality one. As a result, a ReadMe Generator will be used to generate a professional ReadMe file for your projects.

# Technologies used:

* Javascript => for logic
* Node.js => to execute application without HTMLs or browser
* Inquirer => Command line Interface for node.js and is used to:
  - asking questions,
  - validating answers
  - provide error feedback,
  - parsing input,
  - and managing hierarchical prompts.

# Lessons Learned:

This project was my first:
* application to a backend development process and use of command line interfaces
* application of node.js and Inquirer to create a program
* time using screen recording app to demo an application

# Launch:
